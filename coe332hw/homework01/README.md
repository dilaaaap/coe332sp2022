1.
The first python script OddEven.py takes a random list of ten numbers, n. If n%2 == 0, the number is even 
and it prints out "n is even". Otherwise it prints, "n is odd".


2.
The second python script takes each number from i = (3,100) and attempts to divide it by each of the numbers lower
than it in n = (2,100). If it finds a number lower than i that can divide it without a remainder, it is not prime,
so the loop breaks because we don't want to try to divide by numbers higher than i. 
Then if each of the numbers has a remainder it prints the number as it is prime.
